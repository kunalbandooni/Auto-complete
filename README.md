# Auto-complete

Implemented Auto Complete 
As you type, it shows the words changing accordingly.

But, it shows only one line...
(As, UI showing other words is still to be updated.)

- How to use this app (because, it still is under development...)
    - 1. Add some words. (I have added 5-6 words myself)
    - 2. Now search from those words.
    - 3. It must word for at least the words you added. :D

- Here, I have used Trie Data Structure.
- @https://github.com/bot-7037 helped me a lot in JS (Cheers for NIGGA!!)
